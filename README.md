# Shopping Cart

This is a React application that allows the user to add available grocery items from a "Product List" to a "Shopping Cart." Each time a button with a product name is clicked, the quantity of that item in the Product List reduces by one, and the quantity of that item in the Shopping Cart increases by one. 

How to Run

This is a React application that runs in the browser. Node.js and npm need to be installed on the user's machine. A "npm start" command must also be used in order to launch the application in the user's default web browser. To use the Shopping Cart, the user clicks on the grocery item from the Product List that they wish to add to the Shopping Cart. The Shopping Cart will "fill up" with these grocery items, until the quantity of said item in the Product List is equal to 0.

Roadmap of Future Improvements

In the future, I would like to add more styling to the Shopping Cart.
